<p>The jargon file</p>

<p>AFAIK: //, n.</p>

<p>[Usenet; common] Abbrev. for [As Far As I Know]. There is a variant AFAICT
[As Far As I Can Tell]; where AFAIK suggests that the writer knows his
knowledge is limited, AFAICT suggests that he feels his knowledge is as
complete as anybody else's but that the best available knowledge does not
support firm conclusions.</p>

<p>Blue Screen of Death: n.</p>

<p>[common] This term is closely related to the older Black Screen of Death but
much more common (many non-hackers have picked it up). Due to the extreme
fragility and bugginess of Microsoft Windows, misbehaving applications can
readily crash the OS (and the OS sometimes crashes itself spontaneously). The
Blue Screen of Death, sometimes decorated with hex error codes, is what you get
when this happens. (Commonly abbreviated BSOD.) The following entry from the
Salon Haiku Contest, seems to have predated popular use of the term:</p>

<p>Windows NT crashed.</p>

<p>I am the Blue Screen of Death</p>

<p>No one hears your screams.</p>

<p>FAQ: /F·A·Q/, /fak/, n.</p>

<p>[Usenet]</p>

<p>1. A Frequently Asked Question.</p>

<p>2. A compendium of accumulated lore, posted periodically to high-volume
newsgroups in an attempt to forestall such questions. Some people prefer the
term 'FAQ list' or 'FAQL' /fa´kl/, reserving 'FAQ' for sense 1.</p>

<p>This lexicon itself serves as a good example of a collection of one kind of
lore, although it is far too big for a regular FAQ posting. Examples: 'What is
the proper type of NULL?' and 'What's that funny name for the # character?' are
both Frequently Asked Questions. Several FAQs refer readers to the Jargon
File.</p>

<p>FUD: /fuhd/, n.</p>

<p>Defined by Gene Amdahl after he left IBM to found his own company: 'FUD is
the fear, uncertainty, and doubt that IBM sales people instill in the minds of
potential customers who might be considering [Amdahl] products.' The idea, of
course, was to persuade them to go with safe IBM gear rather than with
competitors' equipment. This implicit coercion was traditionally accomplished
by promising that Good Things would happen to people who stuck with IBM, but
Dark Shadows loomed over the future of competitors' equipment or software. See
IBM. After 1990 the term FUD was associated increasingly frequently with
Microsoft, and has become generalized to refer to any kind of disinformation
used as a competitive weapon.</p>

<p>[In 2003, SCO sued IBM in an action which, among other things, alleged SCO's
proprietary control of Linux. The SCO suit rapidly became infamous for the
number and magnitude of falsehoods alleged in SCO's filings. In October 2003,
SCO's lawyers filed a memorandum in which they actually had the temerity to
link to the web version of this entry in furtherance of their claims. Whilst we
appreciate the compliment of being treated as an authority, we can return it
only by observing that SCO has become a nest of liars and thieves compared to
which IBM at its historic worst looked positively angelic. Any judge or law
clerk reading this should surf through to my collected resources on this topic
for the appalling details.-ESR]</p>

<p>GIYF: n.</p>

<p>Abbrev: Google Is Your Friend. Used to suggest, gently and politely, that
you have just asked a question of human beings that would have been better
directed to a search engine. See also STFW.</p>

<p>IANAL: //</p>

<p>[Usenet] Abbreviation, [I Am Not A Lawyer]. Usually precedes legal
advice.</p>

<p>IMHO: //, abbrev.</p>

<p>[from SF fandom via Usenet; abbreviation for 'In My Humble Opinion'] 'IMHO,
mixed-case C names should be avoided, as mistyping something in the wrong case
can cause hard-to-detect errors - and they look too Pascalish anyhow.' Also
seen in variant forms such as IMNSHO (In My Not-So-Humble Opinion) and IMAO (In
My Arrogant Opinion).</p>

<p>indent style: n.</p>

<p>[C, C++, and Java programmers] The rules one uses to indent code in a
readable fashion. There are four major C indent styles, described below; all
have the aim of making it easier for the reader to visually track the scope of
control constructs. They have been inherited by C++ and Java, which have C-like
syntaxes. The significant variable is the placement of { and } with respect to
the statement(s) they enclose and to the guard or controlling statement (if,
else, for, while, or do) on the block, if any.</p>

<p>K&amp;R style - Named after Kernighan &amp; Ritchie, because the examples in
K&amp;R are formatted this way. Also called kernel style because the Unix
kernel is written in it, and the 'One True Brace Style' (abbrev. 1TBS) by its
partisans. In C code, the body is typically indented by eight spaces (or one
tab) per level, as shown here. Four spaces are occasionally seen in C, but in
C++ and Java four tends to be the rule rather than the exception.</p>

<p>if (&lt;cond&gt;) {</p>

<p>&lt;body&gt;</p>

<p>}</p>

<p>Allman style - Named for Eric Allman, a Berkeley hacker who wrote a lot of
the BSD utilities in it (it is sometimes called BSD style). Resembles normal
indent style in Pascal and Algol. It is the only style other than K&amp;R in
widespread use among Java programmers. Basic indent per level shown here is
eight spaces, but four (or sometimes three) spaces are generally preferred by
C++ and Java programmers.</p>

<p>if (&lt;cond&gt;)</p>

<p>{</p>

<p>&lt;body&gt;</p>

<p>}</p>

<p>Whitesmiths style - popularized by the examples that came with Whitesmiths
C, an early commercial C compiler. Basic indent per level shown here is eight
spaces, but four spaces are occasionally seen.</p>

<p>if (&lt;cond&gt;)</p>

<p>{</p>

<p>&lt;body&gt;</p>

<p>}</p>

<p>GNU style - Used throughout GNU EMACS and the Free Software Foundation code,
and just about nowhere else. Indents are always four spaces per level, with {
and } halfway between the outer and inner indent levels.</p>

<p>if (&lt;cond&gt;)</p>

<p>{</p>

<p>&lt;body&gt;</p>

<p>}</p>

<p>Surveys have shown the Allman and Whitesmiths styles to be the most common,
with about equal mind shares. K&amp;R/1TBS used to be nearly universal, but is
now much less common in C (the opening brace tends to get lost against the
right paren of the guard part in an if or while, which is a Bad Thing).
Defenders of 1TBS argue that any putative gain in readability is less important
than their style's relative economy with vertical space, which enables one to
see more code on one's screen at once. The Java Language Specification
legislates not only the capitalization of identifiers, but where nouns,
adjectives, and verbs should be in method, class, interface, and variable names
(section 6.8). While the specification stops short of also standardizing on a
bracing style, all source code originating from Sun Laboratories uses the
K&amp;R style. This has set a precedent for Java programmers, which most
follow.</p>

<p>Doubtless these issues will continue to be the subject of holy wars.</p>

<p>RTFM: /R·T·F·M/, imp.</p>

<p>[Unix] Abbreviation for 'Read The Fucking Manual'.</p>

<p>1. Used by gurus to brush off questions they consider trivial or annoying.
Compare Don't do that then!.</p>

<p>2. Used when reporting a problem to indicate that you aren't just asking out
of randomness. 'No, I can't figure out how to interface Unix to my toaster, and
yes, I have RTFM.' Unlike sense 1, this use is considered polite. See also FM,
RTFAQ, RTFB, RTFS, STFW, RTM, all of which mutated from RTFM, and compare
UTSL.</p>
